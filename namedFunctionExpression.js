// A named function expression is preferable to an anonymous one because:

// 1. Povides a way to refer to the function from inside of itself
//      e.g. for recursion
//    The name will also be readonly
//    Be consistent

// 2. Having a named function expression will show in your stack trace.
//    So easier debugging

// 3. More self documenting code. Useful names tell other devs what your code does
